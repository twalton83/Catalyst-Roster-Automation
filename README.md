# Catalyst-Roster-Automation
Selenium based Python app that automates the download process for Catalyst reports. 

## The Issue
My current role requires that I download .csvs from multiple webpages in order to update rosters. The website itself is at least one decade outdated, and takes multiple clicks to download a single .csv for one program out of many. My goal is to automate this process using Selenium, so with only a few keystrokes I can automatically download all of the rosters for the day, two times a day.

## Feature Wishlist
  * Automatic Login to Catalyst
  * Downloading .csvs 
  * Automatically runs 2x per day
  * Creation of a Folder, labeled, for the downloads for the day
    * Replacement of the old files 
  * Eventually update the existing rosters in OneDrive
